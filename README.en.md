**NeoDunggeunmo(Neoë‘¥ê·¼ëª¨)** is a general-purpose TrueType font based on a
famous Korean bitmap font "Dunggeunmo-kkol(ë‘¥ê·¼ëª¨ê¼´)", which was designed for
use in DOS.

## Introduction

"Dunggeunmo-kkol" is a public domain bitmap font for DOS designed and released
by Jungtae Kim in 1990s, and it's still widely used in LED sign boards thanks
to its decent design. NeoDunggeunmo is a general-purpose TrueType font with
outline glyphs converted from the bitmap font and some original glyphs which
don't exist in the original font.

Check out [the official website (Korean)](http://neodgm.dalgona.dev) for
more information and a list of glyphs available in NeoDunggeunmo.
